=====================
By Next Minor Release
=====================
* PROPER unittests for threads, which will likely involve splitting them up into smaller functions as they cannot be tested in their current form.
* Rewrap help text in cli.py


===================
Long Term Proposals
===================
* A GUI? There are mentions of a GUI in the you-get source code, why not have one for this?
* Expand upon the functionality of scraping from multiple boards/threads, and allow for the scraping of multiple imageboards at once.
